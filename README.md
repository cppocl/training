C++ training material covering: data types, pointers, references, operators and operator precedence, conditions, loops, classes, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, standard library, additional language features.

Downloading the git tools can be done from here:
https://git-scm.com/

THe source code can be obtained by using the following command:
git clone https://git-scm.com/

remember to run this command from the folder where you wish to put the files and folders.

The training is written for Visual Studio 2015, although there is some support for Visual Studio 2017.
Currently I am manually upgrading the .vcxproj files to VS2017 as I can't install VS2017 without breaking my VS2015 install.
The problem is related to macro explorer failing to work with VS2015 and VS2017 both installed.

The training is designed to start for a beginner and built up to an experienced level, so keep watching...
